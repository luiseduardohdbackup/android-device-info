== android-device-info ==

This README contains output of several fields of the Build class for several Android devices. I created this to make sense of what fields are useful when inspecting a device.

See more info about the Build class in its [https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build.html documentation]

The [http://www.glbenchmark.com/result.jsp GLBenchmark] project has a lot of this info on its website. Pick a device and then navigate to System Information to see if they have any info on the device in question.
